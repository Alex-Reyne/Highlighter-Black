# Highlighter Black

Highlighter Black is a custom start/new-tab page built as a chrome extention. You can upload custom images/gifs to play in the image box and add or delete custom links in the main content container. It also features a Duck Duck Go search bar with a slim, unintrusive design.

Highlighter Black uses React-Typescript for the frontend client-side rendering

It also uses a Node with Express.js and Typescript for the backend and a PostgreSQL Database all deployed to Heroku.

You can view a live demo version that's been deployed to Vercel here [Highlighter Black](https://highlighter-black.vercel.app/)

The demo resets the user image and links in the database every 5 minutes to keep it clean for future visitors so don't worry about messing anything up ðŸ˜Š
